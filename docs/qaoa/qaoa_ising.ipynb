(The important thing here is that each $z_j$ has *two possible values*. By convention, we choose those values to be $\\pm 1$). The QAOA is a general-purpose algorithm whose goal is to produce an assignment of the $z_j$ that gives a relatively low value of $C(z)$.

To be more specific, let's agree that the value of $z_j$ corresponds to the measurement outcome of the Pauli-$Z$ operator on the $j$th qubit.

If all of the qubits are in the $|0\\rangle$ state or all are in the $|1\\rangle$ state, then the energy-per-qubit is $-12/9 = -1.33$ at zero external magnetic field $h$, and will be close to that if the magnetic field is small. Notice that the QAOA algorithm we analyzed above is __not__ getting close to that ground state. Is this a problem?\n",

The QAOA prepares a certain state which is a linear combination of the ground state and many other states. When we measure the qubits, we find the ground-state configuration with some probability. If that probability is relatively large, then after a reasonably small number of measurements we'll locate the ground state.\n",

Can you make a circuit that prepares a state close to the ground state?"
