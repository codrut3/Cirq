(The important thing here is that each $z_j$ has *two possible values*. By convention, we choose those values to be $\\pm 1$). The QAOA is a general-purpose algorithm whose goal is to produce an assignment of the $z_j$ that gives a relatively low value of $C(z)$.

To be more specific, let's agree that the value of $z_j$ corresponds to the measurement outcome of the Pauli-$Z$ operator on the $j$th qubit.
